## ðŸ§ª Introduction & Motivation

- **Goal**: Estimate ecosystem functions using a nutrient budget and project future dynamics.
- **Why it matters**: Soil food webs drive nutrient cycling, which supports ecosystem services.
- **Framing**: Think of this as a budgeting toolâ€”tracking carbon and nutrients like money in an ecosystem economy.

---

## Model Structure & Assumptions

- **Basic structure**: Nodes = organisms or pools; Links = feeding relationships.
- **Key assumptions**:
  - Well-mixed system
  - Equilibrium biomass
  - All inputs/outputs included except basal inputs
  - Essential, non-substitutable elements
- **Visual**: Show the food web diagram (e.g., isopod-detritus-fungi network).

---

## Mathematical Foundation

- **Lotka-Volterra equations**:
  - Carbon dynamics (Eq. 1)
  - Other nutrients (Eq. 2)
- **Budgeting vs. projecting**:
  - Budgeting: Solve for current fluxes assuming equilibrium.
  - Projecting: Use model to simulate future changes.
- **Visual**: Parameter-to-flux diagram (X3 example).

---

## Model Parameters

- **Parameter table**: Assimilation efficiency, production efficiency, nutrient ratios, etc.
- **How parameters influence fluxes**: Walk through one example.
- **Visual**: Show the parameter table and explain one row.

## Case Study: Simple Food Web Example

- **Network**: Isopod, fungi, detritus
- **Steps**:
  1. Build interaction matrix
  2. Define parameters
  3. Assemble food web
  4. Calculate carbon fluxes (solve Ax = b)
  5. Expand to other nutrients
- **Visuals**:
  - Food web diagram
  - A matrix and b vector
  - Output fluxes and mineralization rates

## Dealing with Imbalances

- **Negative mineralization**: What it means and why it happens
- **Solutions**:
  - Adjust diet
  - Increase respiration
- **Visual**: Before and after mineralization rates

## Wrap-Up & Takeaways

- **Key insights**:
  - The model helps quantify nutrient cycling.
  - Carbon is the anchor; other nutrients follow via stoichiometry.
  - Useful for both budgeting and projecting ecosystem function.
- **Next steps**: Potential applications, model extensions, or feedback.
